            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THe Governour and Magistrates being assembled in Councill to confider of the publick affairs of this Common-Weal, and being sensible of many humbling Providences of the Lord, wherein doe appear no small Tokens of his frowns towards us, whome he hath so signally owned for many yeares, to the just admiration of Strangers, as well as of our selves, and that now by our unsuitable walkings, and unanswerable returns, we should provoke him to threaten us with loosening the bridle of the Heathen that are neighbouring to us. Which in conjunction with many other afflicting Dispensations of divine Providence, doth minister just ground to fear least the anger of God be kindled against us,</hi>

            <p>Do commend to all the People of this <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> as their indubitable duty, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider thereof, and to judge our selves for all those many sins and evills that doe abound among us, to the dishonour of God, and our Profession of his great Name, and to implore his Compassions to be towards us, freely pardoning all our Sins and Transgressions, and that he would give us Repentance for the same, and turn, his People again unto himself, to seek the Lord God of our Fathers with all our hearts and that his favourable presence may be with us, blessing this present Expedition for rebuking the rage of the Heathen, lengthening out our Peace, and blessing the fruits of the Earth, that we may yet further experience his goodness towards us, And for that end doe nominate and appoint the 29th. day of this Instant <hi>June</hi> to be kept as a day of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Prayer;</hi> and doe order that all the Ministers and People of this Jurisdiction respectively attend and keep the same; and where there shall be any failure for want of seasonable notice, that the 8th day of the next Moneth be by them kept as a day of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> unless the Providence of God shall otherwise eminently divert, and give us just cause to turn the same into a day of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanks-giving.</hi>
